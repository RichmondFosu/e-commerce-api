## 🌟 Repo Review (Attractive Version)

**E-commerce Product API** built with **Django & DRF** — a fully functional backend for managing products and categories.

* ✅ Secure: Only authenticated users can create or modify products, with ownership-based permissions.
* ✅ RESTful & scalable: CRUD operations, clean endpoints, and ready for search, filtering, and pagination.
* ✅ Real-world design: Follows best practices with layered security, modular apps, and admin management.

This project is perfect for learning **professional backend development**, or as a strong foundation for a full e-commerce platform.
